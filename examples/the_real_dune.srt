1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,000
Dune is a movie with giant sandworms,  

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,720
mysterious witches, and Timothee 
Chalamet tripping balls in the desert.  

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,040
There’s spaceships and spice and Zendaya with blue 
eyes, and almost none of it is explained. Even  

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,280
Dune’s characters have to watch YouTube videos to 
understand the story. So what’s going on in Dune? 

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,800
The movie is based on a book that was written 
by Frank Herbert in the 60s. There have been  

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,320
many attempts to adapt this book to movies 
and TV and most of them.. aren’t very good.  

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,560
Dune has been called “unfilmable” because the book 
is so.. weird and complicated. The writing is full  

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,880
of internal monologue and thoughts instead of 
action and dialogue. The plot is layered with  

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,760
heaps of secret plans and hidden motivations. Its 
worldbuilding is richly detailed with hundreds of  

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,480
words for its languages, cultures and religions. 
Dune explores big ideas about consciousness,  

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,120
politics, and philosophy. And the Dune sequel 
books get increasingly strange and cerebral.  

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,720
The new movie is a.. pretty close adaptation of 
the first half of the first book. But it still  

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,320
leaves out a lot of important plotlines and 
details. So how does the book compare to the  

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,960
movie – what’s the real story of Dune? This 
video has spoilers for the 2021 Dune movie,  

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,240
and for the first half of the first book. It has 
no big spoilers for the next Dune movie or for  

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,760
the sequel books, but it does mention some small 
lore details and quotes from the sequel books. 

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,280
So Dune is set thousands of years in the future. 
Humans live on many planets across the universe.  

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,640
And they’re ruled by the Emperor, Shaddam the 
Fourth – we see the Emperor’s Herald in the movie,  

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,400
but we don’t see Shaddam himself. Beneath 
the Emperor are the Great Houses, like House  

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,440
Atreides and House Harkonnen – powerful political 
dynasties who rule planets with armies and wealth.  

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,000
The Houses meet in a congress called the 
Landsraad, which balances against the power  

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,400
of the Emperor. The other big political power is 
the Spacing Guild – cause the Guild controls all  

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,400
interstellar spaceflight. Guild navigators use 
a drug called spice that lets them see into the  

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,120
future – which is the only way to guide spaceships 
safely across the stars. In the movie, these big  

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,720
Guild spaceships, called Heighliners, look like 
tunnels that you can pass through to instantly  

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,000
reach a distant planet – you can see another world 
through this ship, it’s like a wormhole. The later  

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Dune books describe this as folding space.
The Guild is “secretive” and mysterious – it’s  

28
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,200
hinted that Guild navigators have “mutated” and 
“don’t look … human anymore”. So everyone kinda  

29
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,880
hates the Guild for being creepy extortionate 
space weirdos, but everyone needs them to travel. 

30
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,080
So for thousands of years, the universe has 
been ruled by this balance of the Emperor,  

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Houses and Guild. They’re bound together 
by a Great Convention, which has rules  

32
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,840
banning the use of nuclear weapons. But a cheeky 
bit of assassination and warfare is allowed within  

33
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,200
limits. Politics in Dune is a deadly game. Every 
noble family watches their back for assassins,  

34
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,240
and tests their food for poison. The 
Houses rule their planets under a strict  

35
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,800
feudal class system – slavery, oppression, and 
exploitation are common – this is an unfair,  

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,560
unequal universe. The Houses have shares in 
the CHOAM Company, which controls trade in  

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,440
the universe. It’s kinda like the Dutch East 
India Company, or Amazon in space. CHOAM means  

38
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,440
money, and all the Houses fight for a slice. In 
this struggle, a tiny shift in interest rates  

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:01,040
can “change the ownership of an entire planet”.
Science and technology is limited in Dune. Like,  

40
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,840
there are giant spaceships and laser guns, but 
there are strictly no computers, or robots, or AI.  

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,960
Cause thousands of years in the past, 
people did rely on “thinking machines”,  

42
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,720
but then some people used those machines to take 
over the world and enslave people, and it sucked.  

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,720
So then there was a religious crusade called the 
Butlerian Jihad that destroyed all the computers  

44
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,600
and banned them forever. In the Orange Catholic 
Bible it is written “Thou shalt not make a machine  

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,400
in the likeness of a man’s mind”. The idea is 
that thinking and making our own decisions is  

46
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,080
what makes us human. Letting machines think for us 
makes us less free, less conscious – so that’s why  

47
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,760
the machines were destroyed. Ever since, humans 
have had to learn to think for themselves. They  

48
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,240
founded schools to train the human mind and body 
to its full potential. So now there are people  

49
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,360
called Mentats – “Human computers” who can think 
super logically. They process data, calculate  

50
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,320
probabilities, and perceive peoples’ motives. The 
Mentat Thufir Hawat works as a strategic advisor  

51
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,560
to House Atreides. In the books, Mentats take a 
drug called sapho to make themselves smarter, and  

52
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,960
the drug stains their lips red. In the new movie, 
Mentats just have tattoos on their lips instead.  

53
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,160
Like the Mentats, the Navigators of the 
Spacing Guild have trained their brains to  

54
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,200
calculate the mathematics of spaceflight.
And the other important school is the  

55
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,280
Bene Gesserit, an ancient mystical order of 
women with highly trained minds and bodies.  

56
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Their practice is influenced by Zen Buddhism, 
with meditation and contemplation to achieve  

57
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,760
inner balance. Bene Gesserit can precisely control 
all their muscles and nerves, even their body’s  

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,600
biochemistry and their reproductive systems. 
They have powerful memories and perception,  

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,720
they can read peoples’ feelings through their 
words and body language. They can control people  

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,000
with their Voice, they can fight in the weirding 
way, they’re basically.. ninja nuns. The Bene  

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,480
Gesserit are named after the Jesuits, a real-world 
Catholic order. Like the Jesuits, the Bene  

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,840
Gesserit do missionary work in distant places. And 
they have political ambitions. The Bene Gesserit  

63
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,000
work with the Emperor and Houses, and they say 
they live to serve. But the Bene Gesserit have  

64
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,160
their own plans – for centuries, these witches 
have manipulated the universe from the shadows. 

65
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:46,160
So Dune is about a galactic empire with 
medieval politics. It’s a sci fi future  

66
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,800
that rejects technology, and instead focusses on 
the power of the human mind. The author of Dune  

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,720
Frank Herbert was fascinated with thinking, 
learning, and language. How we can expand  

68
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,400
our consciousness to better see the universe 
– sometimes with the help of psychedelics.  

69
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Characters in Dune are constantly getting high, 
expanding their minds and arguing about philosophy  

70
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,400
like college undergrads. So Dune is basically 
like Game of Thrones, in space, on drugs. 

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,200
And the most important drug is spice. Cause spice 
not only makes spaceflight possible and can give  

72
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,160
visions of the future – spice also makes people 
live longer, extending lifespans by decades.  

73
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,920
Many people are addicted to spice, and if they 
stop taking it, they’ll die. It’s an addictive,  

74
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,520
psychic, mind-expanding, life-extending, 
spaceship-flying drug, and it tastes like  

75
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,240
cinnamon, so naturally spice is the most valuable 
substance in the universe. And spice only comes  

76
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,480
from one place – the desert planet Arrakis, also 
called Dune. On Arrakis are giant sandworms whose  

77
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,960
life cycle makes spice. Humans harvest the spice 
and sell it, so whoever controls Arrakis becomes  

78
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,600
rich. The conflicts for resources in 
the deserts of Arrakis are comparable  

79
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,720
to conflicts for oil in the Middle East.
For the last eighty years, Arrakis was ruled  

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,360
by the brutal House Harkonnen, led by the Baron 
Vladimir. The Harkonnens come from the planet  

81
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,920
Giedi Prime – “the oil-soaked, blood-soaked 
hell hole of the Imperium”. The movie imagines  

82
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,159
this planet as being totally industrialised – 
exploited and polluted until nature is gone, and  

83
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,199
smog blackens the skies. The Harkonnens exploit 
their people, too – they have slave labourers, sex  

84
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,400
slaves, and gladiator slaves to kill for sport. 
The Harkonnens use and consume everything to feed  

85
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,840
their endless appetites for power and pleasure 
– the Harkonnens are a mouth that swallows all. 

86
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,440
The Baron Vladimir is a ruthless political 
schemer, who constantly indulges his desires  

87
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,760
for food and sex. He’s too fat to support his 
own weight, so he uses suspensor technology  

88
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,760
which lets him levitate. To rule Arrakis, the 
Baron installed his nephew Rabban, who is called  

89
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,360
“the Beast” for his brutality. Rabban is not known 
for his intelligence – the Baron thinks of Rabban  

90
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,440
as “A muscle-minded tank-brain”. The 
Harkonnens are advised by Piter de Vries,  

91
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,800
a “Mentat-Assassin” who loves torture and poison. 
Piter is addicted to spice, and this expensive  

92
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,280
habit forces him to stay loyal to the Baron. The 
Baron uses peoples’ weaknesses to control them. 

93
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,320
In the movie, the Harkonnens have a freaky 
human-spider-thing as a “pet”, which is not  

94
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
in the books, but according to interviews it’s 
meant to be a messed-up science “experiment”,  

95
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,960
this was a human who was made into a monster. In 
the books there is a faction called the Tleilexu,  

96
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,880
who do weird biology experiments, so maybe 
they made this spider. Some fans theorise that  

97
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,520
this spider is Yueh’s captive wife Wanna, made 
into a monster to torture her. But that’s just  

98
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,440
horrifying speculation and is not in the books.
Point is, the Harkonnens are dicks and the spice  

99
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,040
on Arrakis made them rich. But at the start of the 
story, the Emperor orders the Harkonnens to leave,  

100
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,880
and he gives control of the planet to House 
Atreides, led by Duke Leto. The Atreides have  

101
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,440
a reputation for honour and integrity. They 
protect their people and inspire loyalty in  

102
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,040
return. The Atreides are descended from 
Atreus and Agamemnon of ancient Greece.  

103
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,280
And they rule the planet Caladan – a world 
of oceans and jungles, farming and fishing.  

104
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,440
The Atreides aren’t very rich, but Leto is popular 
and influential among the houses of the Landsraad.  

105
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,760
And the Emperor hates that – he sees Leto’s 
popularity as a threat. So when Shaddam gives  

106
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,920
them Arrakis, that seems like a good thing for 
the Atreides. But really, Arrakis is a trap – the  

107
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Emperor and the Harkonnens secretly plan to 
destroy the Atreides – with an army of Sardaukar. 

108
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,240
Sardaukar are the Emperor’s elite soldiers. 
Renowned for being brutal and merciless,  

109
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,400
they’re said to be the deadliest soldiers in the 
universe. The Sardaukar come from Salusa Secundus,  

110
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,160
a prison planet for the worst criminals in 
the universe. Salusa is a “hell world” where  

111
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,720
only the strongest survive – and it’s this harsh 
environment that makes the Sardaukar so powerful.  

112
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,200
The Emperor doesn’t want the other houses 
to know that he’s attacking the Atreides,  

113
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,680
so in the book, his Sardaukar are 
disguised in Harkonnen uniforms.  

114
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,840
He and the Harkonnens want the 
Atreides to “die in the dark”. 

115
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:00,160
The story begins with Paul Atreides – son of 
the Duke Leto and Lady Jessica. Paul is just  

116
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,600
fifteen years old in the book, and as the heir to 
House Atreides, there’s a lot of pressure on him.  

117
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
He has no friends his own age because of the 
dangers of assassination. He’s highly trained  

118
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,280
in politics, and in combat, and in the book 
he’s trained as a Mentat – to have a powerful  

119
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:24,080
logical mind like Thufir. Jessica trains Paul in 
the way of the Bene Gesserit, to focus his mind  

120
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,680
and body, his perception and memory, and to 
use the power of the Voice to control people. 

121
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,280
It might seem unrealistic to control someone 
with your Voice. But author Frank Herbert  

122
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,960
said we do it “all the time” – like, it’s 
easy to make someone angry with an insult,  

123
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,040
or happy with a compliment. And with 
practice, you can control people in more  

124
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,560
subtle and powerful ways – like politicians 
and advertisers do. You’ve just gotta know  

125
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,880
your audience, use the right words and 
tone. Like and subscribe to Alt Shift X. 

126
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,640
So Paul is young, but he’s a politician and a 
warrior with a powerful highly-trained mind. 

127
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,160
Leto visits the grave of his father, the Old 
Duke. The Old Duke used to fight bulls for sport,  

128
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,960
as a matador. Until he was killed by a bull in the 
ring. The Atreides family keep the head of this  

129
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:30,000
bull, with the Old Duke’s blood still preserved 
on its horns. So the bull head represents facing  

130
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,400
danger, putting yourself at risk. Just like Leto 
is putting himself in danger by coming to Arrakis.  

131
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,320
Leto knows that the Emperor and the Harkonnens 
plan to attack him. But he takes the risk anyway,  

132
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,880
because he believes he can win. Leto plans to 
use the “desert power” of Arrakis, by making an  

133
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,480
alliance with the Fremen, the local desert people. 
In the book, Leto believes that the Fremen will be  

134
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,920
great soldiers specifically because they live in 
the harsh environment of Arrakis – just like the  

135
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,280
Sardaukar are powerful because of the harshness 
of Salusa Secundus. Author Frank Herbert was very  

136
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,560
interested in how environments affect people, 
and how people affect their environment.  

137
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,240
So Leto bets everything on this plan to make 
the Fremen his army to beat the Sardaukar. In  

138
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,520
the movie, Paul says he doesn’t want to exploit 
or oppress the Fremen like the Harkonnens did.  

139
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,200
But in the book, the Atreides don’t care about the 
Fremen like that – their goal is to exploit them.  

140
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,240
The Atreides may seem like heroic good guys, 
like House Stark in space, but throughout  

141
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,840
the book they use immoral manipulative 
strategies, and we’re invited to question  

142
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,520
their morality. In the movie, Chani 
asks “who will our next oppressors be?” 

143
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,600
In the movie, Paul complains that he doesn’t get 
to take risks and have adventures. He questions  

144
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,160
whether he even wants to be a duke and to lead the 
Atreides. Leto is understanding, and says he loves  

145
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,720
Paul no matter what. It’s a touching moment 
of unconditional love between father and son. 

146
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,040
But in the book, we don’t see this kind of 
softness. The Atreides are more formal and distant  

147
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:20,640
and serious, book-Paul does not question his duty 
to their house. The Atreides in the book are an  

148
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:27,360
ancient dynasty in a deadly planetary conflict, 
and they are not fucking around. While the movie  

149
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,404
humanises the Atreides, and makes them feel more 
like a normal relatable family, showing affection,  

150
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:35,760
having breakfast, practicing mind control.
The Atreides get a visit from Gaius  

151
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,680
Helen Mohiam. Gaius is a Reverend Mother, a 
special high-ranking Bene Gesserit who has  

152
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,080
expanded her mind using drugs. Reverend Mothers 
have access to the memories of their ancestors  

153
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,480
and of other Reverend Mothers. Gaius was Jessica’s 
teacher back at the Bene Gesserit school. And now  

154
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,160
she’s the personal Truthsayer of the Emperor 
– he uses her for her ability to detect  

155
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:08,240
lies. So Gaius is a powerful, important person 
and she has complicated loyalties to the Emperor  

156
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,440
and to Jessica and to the Bene Gesserit.
Gaius gives Paul a test. Paul puts his hand in  

157
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,600
a box that causes terrible pain – but if he moves 
his hand, Gaius will kill him with a needle called  

158
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,720
the gom jabbar. So this is a test of self-control. 
Someone without self-control, like an animal, will  

159
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,960
instinctively move away from the pain and will 
die. To survive, you have to withstand the pain,  

160
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,520
control your body and mind, master your fear and 
your instincts. The Bene Gesserit believe that  

161
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:48,560
this ability to act consciously, and choose, to 
think long-term not just in the moment, is what  

162
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,440
separates humans from animals. They give this test 
to everyone they train, so that only responsible  

163
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
conscious humans gain the power of the Bene 
Gesserit. Anyone who fails this test, they kill. 

164
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,160
Before the test, we see the Atreides 
bull head – cause like the Old Duke  

165
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,600
with the bull, and Leto with Arrakis, 
Paul faces deadly danger in this test. 

166
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,240
When Jessica was trained as a Bene Gesserit, 
she took this test too. So she knows the pain  

167
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,319
Paul is feeling and is terrified he might die. 
To calm herself, she recites the Litany Against  

168
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,800
Fear – “Fear is the mind-killer”, but the 
fear will pass through me and I will remain.  

169
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,480
The Bene Gesserit train to calm their emotions 
and focus their mind. And Jessica’s training  

170
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,440
helps Paul pass this test. Paul is “human”, 
he has self-control, so he withstands the pain  

171
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,440
and lives. In the movie, he also has fiery 
visions of the upcoming Harkonnen attack. 

172
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,360
Then we learn about the Bene Gesserits’ 
secret plan. For thousands of years,  

173
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,120
the Bene Gesserit have manipulated the genetic 
lines of noble families like the Atreides.  

174
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,440
They breed certain people with other people, 
often by marriage to Bene Gesserits like Jessica.  

175
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
Even the Emperor has a Bene Gesserit 
wife controlling his reproduction.  

176
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,840
They select and combine certain genes, trying to 
produce a superhuman called the Kwisatz Haderach.  

177
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,800
This chosen one will be able see into the 
future and past better than any Bene Gesserit.  

178
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,320
Cause Reverend Mothers like Gaius can only 
access the memories of their female ancestors.  

179
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,480
The Kwisatz Haderach will access all memories. 
He’ll be a male Reverend Mother whose powerful  

180
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,120
mind will guide humanity. The name Kwisatz 
Haderach is borrowed from a real Hebrew term  

181
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:52,160
meaning to “shorten the way” between two places.
So the Bene Gesserit want to create the Chosen  

182
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,720
One. But Jessica has messed with their 
plan. Cause the Bene Gesserit wanted  

183
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,480
Jessica to have a daughter, not a son. That 
daughter was gonna marry a Harkonnen, and  

184
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,800
their child would’ve been the Kwisatz Haderach. 
But Jessica, with her Bene Gesserit body control,  

185
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,360
chose to have a son, Paul, instead, because Leto 
wanted a son and Jessica wanted to make him happy.  

186
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,680
She chose her family over her duty to the 
Bene Gesserit. Jessica hopes that Paul will  

187
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,880
be the Kwisatz Haderach instead, but Gaius is 
doubtful – their ancient plan is now uncertain. 

188
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,800
So Paul might be the Chosen One, and he’s.. 
not happy about it. It feels weird and gross  

189
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:43,600
that he’s the product of the Bene Gesserit’s human 
breeding program, their manipulative eugenic plan.  

190
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,160
In the book he feels an “offense” against his 
“instinct for rightness”. He questions Gaius,  

191
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,080
thinks she’s a “fatuous old witch” full of 
meaningless “platitudes”. In other sci fi stories,  

192
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,520
the hero’s magical mentors are good and wise 
and pure like Obi-Wan and Gandalf the White. But  

193
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,640
Gaius is a creepy witch in a black robe who works 
for the Emperor who’s trying to kill Paul’s dad.  

194
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,280
The Bene Gesserit are a shadowy political cult. 
And their plan to artificially create the chosen  

195
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,320
one seems sinister and dark. In the book, Paul 
feels that he is “infected” with a “terrible  

196
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,960
purpose” that he doesn’t understand. So what 
is Paul’s destiny, and it really a good thing?  

197
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,480
Dune is about questioning the whole idea of 
heroes, religions, politicians, predictions  

198
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,440
and plans. It’s about the danger of anything 
that reduces our ability to think for ourselves. 

199
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,040
One of Paul’s teachers is Gurney Halleck. 
Gurney is a legendary fighter, like one of  

200
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,160
the best in the universe. He’s also a musician 
and a poet – a “minstrel-warrior” who plays an  

201
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,520
instrument called a baliset. They did film a 
baliset scene for the movie, but it was cut.  

202
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,520
In the book, Gurney often sings, and quotes poetry 
and wise scripture and dirty lyrics. His charming  

203
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,560
words and music help the Atreides win allies and 
influence people. Gurney is described as an “ugly  

204
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:28,160
lump of a man”. He's got a big red scar across his 
face – and a burning hatred for the Harkonnens.  

205
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,760
Cause in the book, Gurney was once a slave 
of the Harkonnens. The Beast Rabban killed  

206
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,440
Gurney’s family, and gave him his scar – 
so Gurney wants revenge. Gurney says in  

207
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,480
the movie that the Harkonnens are so brutal 
that they’re “not human”. The Harkonnens are  

208
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,080
often described as animals or beasts ruled 
by their impulses – which contrasts with  

209
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,960
the idea of humans with conscious self-control.
Paul and Gurney train at fighting using shields.  

210
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,240
Shields are force fields that can stop any 
fast-moving object, but a slow blade can get  

211
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,440
through. Guns and explosives are useless 
against shields, so that’s why soldiers  

212
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,520
in Dune fight with swords and knives instead. 
The trick to shield fighting is to out-smart,  

213
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,720
out-manoeuvre, and distract your opponent 
so you can kill with a sneaky slow attack.  

214
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,040
So like everything in Dune, even the sword fights 
are smart and strategic, like a chess game. 

215
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,120
Paul says that he’s not in the mood for fighting, 
but Gurney says you must always be ready,  

216
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,160
no matter how you feel. So just like 
with the gom jabbar test, this is about  

217
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,480
self-control. To survive the deadly blade, 
you must master your emotions, your body  

218
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,640
and mind. In the book, Gurney fights Paul so 
aggressively that for a moment Paul thinks he  

219
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,080
might be really be trying to kill him. Gurney is 
warning Paul to be ready for anything on Arrakis]. 

220
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,280
One of Paul’s other teachers is Duncan Idaho, who 
is also a legendary fighter. He’s a “Swordmaster  

221
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:00,560
of the Ginaz”, a “military genius”, he’s super 
hot, and is fiercely loyal to the Atreides.  

222
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Duncan is a close friend to Paul, almost like 
a big brother. In the movie, Paul tells Duncan  

223
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,560
about the dreams he’s been having of the future 
– of this Fremen girl Chani, and of Duncan dying  

224
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,240
on Arrakis. These prescient visions are part of 
Paul’s power as the potential Kwisatz Haderach.  

225
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,280
In the movie, Duncan tells Paul not to focus too 
much on dreams – he says “everything important  

226
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,400
happens when we're awake”. Cause Dune is about the 
power of thoughts and visions, but it also warns  

227
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,680
us not to get too sucked in to our own minds, our 
assumptions and plans. “the mystery of life isn’t  

228
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,600
a problem to solve, but a reality to experience” 
– the deepest truths, and the joy and meaning in  

229
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,680
life, come from living in the present.
Before he leaves his homeworld,  

230
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:01,040
Paul walks a Caladan beach. Caladan is a planet 
of water to contrast the harsh dry deserts  

231
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,600
of Arrakis. Caladan is beautiful, plentiful, a 
“paradise”. But the book says that the comforts  

232
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,640
of Caladan made the Atreides go soft. Life 
was too easy, they got undisciplined. Dune  

233
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,800
says that people need adversity and hard times 
in order to grow and achieve our potential.  

234
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,000
And Arrakis is the ultimate challenge. It’s a 
test, like the gom jabbar, like the bull. Now Paul  

235
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,120
goes “into the fire”. Will Arrakis forge him 
stronger, like the Fremen? Or will Paul burn? 

236
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,400
The Atreides arrive on Arrakis, 
and this guy blasts a bagpipe solo. 

237
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,080
When the people of Arrakis see Paul and 
Jessica, they shout “Lisan al-Gaib”,  

238
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:54,160
which means “the Voice from the Outer World”. 
Because there’s a prophecy on Arrakis that  

239
00:24:54,160 --> 00:25:00,640
there will come a leader, the child of a Bene 
Gesserit, who will lead Arrakis to freedom.  

240
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,360
Paul and Jessica seem to fit this prophecy. 
But thing is, this prophecy is a lie – it was  

241
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,040
made up by the Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit 
have a whole system called the Missionaria  

242
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:19,680
Protectiva – for thousands of years, they have 
spread specific religious ideas or “infectious  

243
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,960
superstitions” all over the universe. Particular 
signs and sayings are planted in local cultures,  

244
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,520
so if a Bene Gesserit is ever on one of these 
planets, they can use those signs and sayings  

245
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,560
to gain power over people – by fulfilling the 
prophecies that they invented. Dune author Frank  

246
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,840
Herbert said this was inspired by missionaries 
in the real world, who use religion to manipulate  

247
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,680
and exploit other cultures. So the people of 
Arrakis hope that Paul and Jessica are the  

248
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:51,840
chosen ones who will free them. But really, 
the Lisan al-Gaib prophecy is a cynical tool  

249
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,000
used by the Bene Gesserit to control people.
The Atreides move into their new home in the  

250
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,080
city of Arrakeen. And Jessica hires a Fremen 
woman called Mapes to be a housekeeper.  

251
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,120
Not all the people of Arrakis are Fremen. 
Like, the people of the cities and villages  

252
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,120
aren’t Fremen. The Fremen are their own specific 
culture who live out in the desert – a “renegade”  

253
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,280
“will-o’-the-sand” people who live outside the 
control of the Imperium. Fremen all have blue  

254
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,760
eyes because their environment is saturated with 
spice – and spice is coloured blue in the books.  

255
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,000
Fremen have a reputation for being “fierce” 
and “dangerous” – “They compose poems to  

256
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,160
their knives”. The Harkonnens and the Emperor 
see the Fremen as “scum” and “barbarians” who  

257
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,360
“aren’t worth considering”. They think there 
are only a few thousand Fremen living on the  

258
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,320
edge of the desert. But the Atreides 
think there could be lots more Fremen,  

259
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,240
and that they could be more powerful than they 
seem. So the Fremen are mystery at the start of  

260
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,200
the book, and we gradually learn more about them.
Mapes has the honorary title Shadout, which means  

261
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,080
“well-dipper” – cause water is super 
important in the Fremen desert culture. 

262
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,200
And Mapes isn’t just here for a job interview. She 
came to test Jessica, to see if she really fits  

263
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,480
the prophecy of the Lisan al-Gaib. So Mapes shows 
Jessica a crysknife, a blade made from the tooth  

264
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,440
of a sandworm. And she asks Jessica what is the 
meaning of the knife. Jessica says it’s a “maker”,  

265
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,560
and Mapes gets all excited, because the 
Fremen call sandworms “makers”. So this  

266
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,920
shows that Jessica must know the secrets of Fremen 
religion – she and Paul must be the Lisan al-Gaib. 

267
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,720
But thing is, in the book, Jessica is bullshitting 
Mapes. Jessica doesn’t know the religious meaning  

268
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,560
of the crysknife. She was gonna say that the 
knife is a “maker of death”, to mean it’s, just,  

269
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,280
a weapon, but Mapes interrupted Jessica 
once she heard what she wanted to hear.  

270
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Jessica then plays along and acts like she knows 
this Fremen religious stuff, using signs and  

271
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,640
sayings from the Missionaria Protectiva, but 
inside Jessica knows this is a “sham”. Jessica  

272
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:20,560
exploits Mapes’ religion to manipulate her and win 
her loyalty. Dune is about the danger of religion,  

273
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:27,520
how it can warp our thinking and control us.
But this isn’t just about the Atreides using  

274
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,440
the Fremen. In the book, after Jessica leaves, 
Mapes says to herself that Jessica is “the One”,  

275
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,240
“Poor thing”. Mapes pities Jessica, and knows 
things about her future. It’s hinted that  

276
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,560
just as the Atreides use the Fremen, the Fremen 
may be using the Atreides for their own goals. 

277
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,040
Paul is attacked by a hunter-seeker – a weapon of 
assassination. It’s like a flying remote-control  

278
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,560
needle – a “ravening sliver of metal” that 
can burrow into flesh to strike the heart.  

279
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,800
The hunter-seeker is controlled remotely by a 
Harkonnen assassin. The camera on the seeker is  

280
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,360
bad, so it relies on motion to find its target. 
So to survive, Paul has to stand perfectly still  

281
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,320
while the deadly needle points at his face. So 
this is just like the gom jabbar test – Paul  

282
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,960
faces a deadly needle, and to survive he has 
to stay still, mastering his fear and his body. 

283
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,440
Meanwhile, in the book, Jessica explores her new 
home and she finds a mysterious door locked with  

284
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,440
a palm reader – which is a lock that only opens 
to the shape of a particular person’s hand.  

285
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
So Jessica picks the lock by subtly 
changing the shape of her own palm  

286
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,520
using her Bene Gesserit muscle control.
In other sci fi stories, characters might use  

287
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:56,080
hacking or magic or raw strength to break a 
lock. But Dune is about the power of the mind,  

288
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,840
so that’s how Jessica opens the door.
Inside, Jessica finds a conservatory.  

289
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,560
A place full of lush plants and water on this 
dry desert world. It’s beautiful, but it’s a  

290
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,640
terrible waste. This much water could sustain 
a thousand lives on Arrakis, but instead it’s  

291
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,240
used for the pleasure of the rich and powerful.
In the movie, there’s a scene with these palm  

292
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,320
trees, which are also a waste of precious water. 
The gardener says that the waste is okay because  

293
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,320
these trees are “sacred”. But in the book, these 
trees aren’t sacred. The people of Arrakis look on  

294
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,080
the trees with “envy” and “hate” for the waste of 
water. The trees represent inequality in the book.  

295
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,440
But the movie takes away that moral complication, 
and instead emphasises the mystical connection  

296
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,200
between Arrakis’ people and its environment.
Anyway in the conservatory, Jessica finds a  

297
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,440
hidden message from another Bene Gesserit. A 
message so secret it’s written on a leaf in  

298
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,520
braille. And it warns her that there’s a traitor 
among the Atreides, working for the Harkonnens. 

299
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,480
In the book, Thufir also gets a message warning 
of the traitor. This message was planted by the  

300
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,920
Harkonnens, and they deliberately trick Thufir 
into thinking that Jessica is the traitor. The  

301
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Harkonnens divide the Atreides, turn them against 
each other, to distract from the real traitor,  

302
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:25,280
Doctor Yueh, who is working for the Harkonnens. 
When Thufir tells Leto, Leto doesn’t believe  

303
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,440
that his beloved Jessica is plotting against him. 
But he decides to pretend that he thinks Jessica  

304
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,360
is the traitor, to make the Harkonnens think they 
tricked him, while he looks for the real traitor.  

305
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,760
So the plot quickly gets complicated in the 
book. Dune is full of these “plans within  

306
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,720
plans” and “plots within plots”. The story is 
a chess game where only the best minds survive. 

307
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,480
And there’s a sense from the start of the 
book that Leto is doomed to fail. That  

308
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,040
he’s “a man snared by Destiny”, caught in an 
inescapable trap. Leto has “death thoughts”,  

309
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,120
thinking about how he’ll die. And Paul is 
shocked to see this vulnerability in his father.  

310
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,800
Paul sees that Leto makes mistakes, and he 
realises that his dad won’t be around forever.  

311
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,080
Part of Paul growing up and becoming a man is 
seeing the flaws and the mortality in his father. 

312
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,800
The Atreides takeover of Arrakis doesn’t go well. 
The Harkonnens left behind broken equipment,  

313
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,960
so the Atreides can’t harvest much spice 
yet. And they’re still expecting an  

314
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,560
attack from the Emperor’s Sardaukar and the 
Harkonnens. Leto’s great hope is the Fremen. 

315
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,720
Leto sent Duncan to try to make an alliance with 
the Fremen. Originally, the Dune movie started  

316
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,400
with a scene of Duncan landing on Arrakis. So 
Duncan meets the Fremen, and he learns that Fremen  

317
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,800
live in caves called sietches. There are millions 
of Fremen living deep in the desert, way more than  

318
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,800
the Harkonnens and Emperor realise. The Fremen 
are also technologically advanced – manufacturing  

319
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,120
devices to help them survive in the desert. Duncan 
also learns the Fremen are deadly in combat.  

320
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,280
So the Harkonnens and the Emperor are too arrogant 
and prejudiced to see the potential of the Fremen.  

321
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,320
But the Atreides are open-minded and willing 
to learn, which opens up new possibilities. 

322
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,640
So the Atreides meet Stilgar, 
the leader of a Fremen sietch.  

323
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,840
The book emphasises Stilgar’s “aura of power”, and 
his commanding voice – he’s an impressive figure.  

324
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,760
Unlike the arrogant Harkonnens, Leto shows 
respect for Stilgar and his people. So Stilgar  

325
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,240
shows respect for Leto by spitting on the table – 
because in Fremen desert culture, giving moisture  

326
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,120
from the body is a sign of respect. Fremen 
culture is shaped by their dry desert environment. 

327
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,280
In the book, Duncan helped the Fremen fight some 
Harkonnens. So Stilgar invites Duncan to join his  

328
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:00,320
Fremen while also serving Leto – representing an 
alliance between Stilgar and the Atreides. Stilgar  

329
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,080
gives Duncan a crysknife, the sacred maker’s 
blade, and it’s mentioned that the Harkonnens  

330
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,840
are offering a huge bounty to anyone who can 
bring them a crysknife. Because anyone who has  

331
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:19,040
a crysknife and has spice-blue eyes would appear 
to be a Fremen – they could infiltrate any sietch.  

332
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,320
And in the book, the Harkonnen Mentat-Assassin 
Piter has blue eyes because of his spice  

333
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,639
addiction. So it seems that the Harkonnens want a 
crysknife so that Piter can infiltrate the Fremen,  

334
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,239
so that he can kill the Atreides if the Atreides 
hide with the Fremen. So this is another  

335
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,839
deadly subplot hidden within the story.
But the meeting with Stilgar goes well,  

336
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,320
so there’s hope for a larger alliance 
between the Atreides and the Fremen. 

337
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,639
The Atreides meet Liet-Kynes. Kynes is an 
ecologist, or planetologist, working for the  

338
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,400
Emperor to study the environment of Arrakis. 
She’s also the Judge of the Change – meaning  

339
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,280
it’s her job to make sure everyone follows the 
rules when the Harkonnens leave Arrakis and the  

340
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,640
Atreides take over. But secretly, the Emperor 
has ordered Kynes to help betray the Atreides,  

341
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,880
and to let the Harkonnens attack them. But Kynes’ 
loyalties are even more complicated than that.  

342
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,320
In the book, Liet-Kynes is a man. Kynes’ father 
was Pardot Kynes, the previous Imperial ecologist.  

343
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,880
And Liet-Kynes’s mother was a Fremen woman. So 
Liet-Kynes was raised as a Fremen on Arrakis.  

344
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,760
Liet-Kynes married a Fremen, and they had a 
child called Chani. Chani is Kynes’ daughter  

345
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,760
in the movie as well as in the book. So Kynes 
works for the Emperor, but Kynes is really loyal  

346
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,800
to the Fremen. Kynes leads the Fremen under the 
name Liet. In the book, “Liet” and “Kynes” seem  

347
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,520
to be two different people at first. The Atreides 
think the mysterious Liet might be the name of a  

348
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,080
Fremen god. It’s only later that we find out that 
Liet the Fremen leader and Kynes the planetologist  

349
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,720
are the same person. So there are two sides 
to Kynes’ identity – Imperial, and Fremen.  

350
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,240
Outsider, and native. Scientist, and leader.
Kynes gives the Atreides stillsuits. Stillsuits  

351
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,840
are special outfits for the desert that cool the 
body and stop it from losing moisture. All of  

352
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,520
your sweat, pee and poop, is captured by the suit 
and reprocessed back into drinking water. Cause  

353
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,200
without a stillsuit, in the desert’s heat, you’ll 
soon lose your moisture and die. The book goes  

354
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,720
into lots of detail on the different technologies 
people use to adapt to Arrakis’ environment. 

355
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,400
Kynes shows the Atreides how to wear their 
stillsuits properly – it’s a difficult, technical  

356
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,480
thing for someone who’s never used one before. But 
Paul somehow already knows how to wear a stillsuit  

357
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,400
properly. And that shocks Kynes, because it fits 
part of the prophecy of the Lisan al-Gaib – “He  

358
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:04,800
shall know your ways as though born to them”. 
Paul’s personality and his words also fit the  

359
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,560
prophecy. In the book, Kynes thinks of himself 
as a rational sceptical scientist who doesn’t  

360
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,800
believe in superstitions. But Paul does fit the 
prophecy. So it seems like there might be some  

361
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,880
truth in the prophecy of the Lisan al-Gaib mixed 
in with the Bene Gesserit’s lies and manipulation. 

362
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,880
The Atreides fly out to the desert to learn 
about spice harvesting. These flying machines  

363
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,000
are called ornithopters, which is a real 
word for flying machines with flapping wings.  

364
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,320
The book describes ’thopters as looking 
like birds with feathered wings. 

365
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Harvester machines extract spice from 
the sand using centrifuges. In the book,  

366
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,520
they look like giant beetles with snouts and 
leglike tracks. The movie uses a simple industrial  

367
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,440
look for its technology, but the books have a 
more fantastical and colourful 60s scifi vibe. 

368
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,800
The vibrations from spice harvesting always 
attract sandworms. So when a worm comes,  

369
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,800
harvesters are flown to safety by a carry-all. 
But this time, the carry-all breaks. In the book,  

370
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,520
it doesn’t turn up at all because of Harkonnen 
sabotage. So Duke Leto heroically risks his life  

371
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,480
to save the workers from the sandworm. This shows 
that Leto genuinely cares about protecting people.  

372
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,680
Human life matters more to him than money, and 
that’s what makes him different to the Harkonnens.  

373
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,160
But Leto isn’t totally selfless – he is a 
politician. So in the book, he and Gurney  

374
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,000
give the workers a bonus payment, and he says it’s 
for “public relations”, to make people like Leto.  

375
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,880
Kynes points out that Leto floods Arrakis with 
propaganda, telling people to “Love the good  

376
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,960
Duke”. And Leto admits that his propaganda 
is a big part of why his men are so loyal.  

377
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:00,000
His image as a heroic leader is partly an act, a 
“mask” for political advantage. So the Atreides do  

378
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,200
show some real heroism, but that image is partly 
a cynical tool that they use to control people. 

379
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,760
In the book, the Atreides host a dinner party 
with important people on Arrakis – businessmen,  

380
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,160
politicians, smugglers – it gives the sense of 
a larger world on Arrakis – this is a planet,  

381
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,000
with lots of different players with 
their own plans and motivations. 

382
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,680
When the Harkonnens were in charge here, they had 
a custom where they’d deliberately waste water,  

383
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,760
dumping it onto towels on the ground, then 
allowing poor people to beg for drops of moisture.  

384
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,240
It was cruel, and demeaning. So Leto stops 
this custom and gives beggars water instead.  

385
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,120
And Jessica declares that the conservatory, 
that wastes so much water, will now be held  

386
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:53,840
in trust for all the people of Arrakis. So again, 
the Atreides do good for people, with gestures of  

387
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:00,720
respect and generosity. Leto says he’s gonna 
change things on Arrakis. Butdoes he really  

388
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,040
make any meaningful changes? Like sure, he gives 
water to a few beggars, but he does nothing change  

389
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,480
this fundamentally unfair feudal political 
system. Right after banning the water custom,  

390
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,120
Leto just does a different water-wasting ritual 
instead. So maybe these gestures are just more  

391
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:25,200
propaganda to make the Atreides look good. 
Dune is critical of politicians who appear  

392
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,600
liberal and progressive, but are really just 
aristocrats protecting their own power. Author  

393
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,120
Frank Herbert said the Atreides are “admirable”, 
but they act “with the same arrogance toward  

394
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,320
"common folk" as do their enemies”.
While the Atreides act honest and  

395
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,000
honourable in public, they do some sneaky 
bullshit on the downlow. Like, the Atreides  

396
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,760
forge signatures to take property and evict the 
families of people who worked for the Harkonnens.  

397
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,160
The Atreides use Thufir, who is a “Master of 
Assassins” whose ruthless methods bring “death  

398
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,520
and deceit” wherever he goes. And Leto’s whole 
plan here is to “exploit” the Fremen as his army  

399
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,720
and exploit the land for spice. Leto says that 
he makes moral compromises for political gain.  

400
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,320
He says the honourable Atreides banner 
“could come to mean many evil things”. 

401
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,680
So the Atreides are more moral than the 
brutal Harkonnens. But their power is  

402
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,720
still fundamentally based on coercion and force.
Like, this dinner party is fancy and glamourous,  

403
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,960
but it’s also very tense – people are nervous 
about getting poisoned – so inside a chandelier,  

404
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,000
there’s a hidden snooper device to detect 
poison. The Atreides use secret hand signals  

405
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,480
to ready their soldiers during dinner. 
This shows the fakeness of political power.  

406
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,840
Behind the formality and glamour there 
is always the deadly threat of violence. 

407
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,560
Some of the most powerful people at the party 
are the those who control water on Arrakis. Cause  

408
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,160
everyone needs water to live, and on this planet 
there’s barely any of it. Paul has to explain to  

409
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,920
someone what drowning is, and what boats are – 
cause there’s isn’t enough water on Arrakis for  

410
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,280
anyone to ever drown or use a boat. So alongside 
spice, water is a precious resource here. Author  

411
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,040
Frank Herbert said the value of water on Arrakis 
is equivalent to oil. And the way this natural  

412
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,800
resource shapes politics and culture shows 
the overarching, constant importance of the  

413
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,920
environment. No one is completely separated from 
natural forces like water scarcity. Not the poor  

414
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,000
begging for drops of moisture, nor the politicians 
who compete to control it. One of the most  

415
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,320
important characters in Dune is the planet itself.
So everyone eats, and makes small talk,  

416
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,920
and secretly plots to destroy each other. 
Jessica realises a Spacing Guild guy is  

417
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,120
working with the Harkonnens. We learn that the 
Harkonnens are smuggling lasguns to Arrakis.  

418
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:12,720
Women try to seduce Paul. A water-seller bickers 
with Kynes. We get a sense of mysterious power  

419
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,480
from Kynes, connected to Kynes’ relationship with 
the Fremen. The Atreides talk about changing the  

420
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,640
environment of Arrakis to give it more water and 
plants, and Kynes acts weird and secretive about  

421
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,960
whether this is possible. And this whole time 
Leto is pretending to think Jessica is a traitor,  

422
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,400
and he’s super stressed about it. So at 
this party, the plots thicken, the tension  

423
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,280
rises, there’s a growing sense of danger to the 
Atreides. All night, the bull head looms above,  

424
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,520
with Atreides blood on its horns.
Later, in the book, Duncan gets  

425
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,840
drunk. He’s stressed, and homesick on this 
dangerous alien world. So he gets wasted,  

426
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:02,720
and complains, and he reveals to Jessica that 
Thufir thinks she’s a traitor. So Jessica finally  

427
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,240
understands why Leto has been acting weird and 
distant with her, pretending to suspect her.  

428
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:16,720
So Jessica confronts Thufir. She says she’s not a 
traitor, and she criticises Thufir’s Mentat logic,  

429
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,560
saying he is good at analysing the world around 
him, but he fails to analyse his own thoughts and  

430
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,760
feelings – she says he’s biased against her for 
being a Bene Gesserit, and that he’s jealous of  

431
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,280
her closeness with Leto. She brags about her 
power and uses her Voice on him – and Thufir  

432
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,440
is shocked to witness the true hidden power 
of the Bene Gesserit. Thufir gets angry too,  

433
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,320
and considers killing Jessica. This in-fighting 
is exactly what the Harkonnens want, and Jessica  

434
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:48,560
realises that. But they fail to work together 
because of their emotions and their differences. 

435
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,240
Jessica and Thufir are a Bene Gesserit and 
a Mentat – both highly trained intelligent  

436
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:02,400
superhumans. But no matter how smart you are, 
everyone has human weaknesses – pride, jealousy,  

437
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,880
anger, fear, biases. Their emotions 
overwhelm their rational minds. And so  

438
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,800
Jessica and Thufir fail to find the real 
traitor, and fail to save their family. 

439
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,680
Leto finds out about this fight between Jessica 
and Thufir. And he feels bad about acting  

440
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,680
suspicious of the woman he loves. He regrets 
that he never married Jessica. Cause technically,  

441
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,480
Jessica is Leto’s concubine, not his wife. Leto 
stays unmarried because it’s politically useful to  

442
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,920
seem like he’s available for a marriage alliance. 
But really he loves Jessica, and wouldn’t marry  

443
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,000
anyone else. Leto goes to tell Jessica the truth 
and to apologise about pretending to suspect  

444
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,480
her – but tragically, before he can tell her, 
Leto is attacked by the real traitor – Yueh. 

445
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,440
So Yueh is the doctor for the Atreides family. And 
in the book, the Atreides think it’s impossible  

446
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,080
for him to be a traitor – because Yueh is a 
Suk School doctor, with Imperial Conditioning.  

447
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,120
Imperial Conditioning is a kind of mental 
training that supposedly makes it impossible  

448
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:17,440
for a Suk doctor to kill or betray their masters. 
This diamond tattoo on Yueh’s forehead is the  

449
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,160
mark of a Suk doctor. But the Harkonnens broke 
Yueh’s conditioning – they captured Yueh’s wife,  

450
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,720
Wanna, and they tortured her, to blackmail Yueh 
into obeying them. So Yueh betrays the Atreides,  

451
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:37,440
but he does it to protect his wife. Yueh doesn’t 
want to hurt the Atreides – he loves them.  

452
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,280
So throughout the book, Yueh feels conflicted, 
guilty, and stressed keeping his secret. 

453
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,080
Yueh thinks that after betraying Leto, he’ll 
be remembered by history as a terrible villain.  

454
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:55,920
And he’s right. Each chapter of the Dune 
book starts with a quote or excerpt from an  

455
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,760
in-universe history book written years after the 
events of the story. They give us glimpses of how  

456
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,240
future historians think about these characters. 
And in these books, Yueh is remembered as “a name  

457
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:15,600
black in treachery”. “A Child’s History” says 
“A million deaths were not enough for Yueh!”.  

458
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:22,560
So this shows how history doesn’t capture the 
full story of peoples’ lives. Yueh is a traitor,  

459
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,120
but he’s not some one-dimensional 
villain – he’s a complex layered  

460
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:33,520
character with his own feelings and perspective.
Earlier in the book, Yueh gives Paul an Orange  

461
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,320
Catholic Bible. He thinks he gives Paul the 
gift of religion before he betrays Paul – so,  

462
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:46,240
Yueh thinks, Paul will now go where Yueh cannot 
go – meaning that Paul will go to heaven,  

463
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,400
but Yueh thinks himself damned to hell.
Yueh talks with Jessica, which is very  

464
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,320
dangerous for Yueh. Because as a Bene Gesserit, 
Jessica can read peoples’ feelings and detect  

465
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:05,760
lies. So Yueh has to carefully control his words 
and emotions to hide that he’s a traitor. He masks  

466
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,000
his secret by expressing his real grief 
for his wife Wanna. Jessica opens up too,  

467
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,080
and they really connect emotionally. So much that 
Yueh almost decides to tell Jessica the truth that  

468
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:23,760
he’s working for the Harkonnens. Jessica sees 
that Yueh is hiding something from her, but she  

469
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,760
decides not to investigate because Yueh is such 
a good friend and she feels she should trust him.  

470
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,760
So this tragic, heartfelt scene makes us 
feel sorry for Yueh before his betrayal. 

471
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,680
Yueh kills Mapes. He hits Leto with a paralysing 
dart. He gives Paul and Jessica sleeping drugs  

472
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,280
so they can be captured. And Yueh turns off the 
Atreides house shields, so the Harkonnens and  

473
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:56,000
Sardaukar can attack. But Yueh also betrays 
the Harkonnens. He installs a fake tooth  

474
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,120
into Leto’s mouth – a weapon filled with poison 
gas. He tells Leto to use it to kill the Baron,  

475
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:09,680
to get revenge for the torture of Wanna.
So the Harkonnens and Sardaukar attack. And  

476
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,840
the Atreides are shocked by how many soldiers 
arrive. The Baron paid the Spacing Guild a huge  

477
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:22,320
amount of money for troop transport. Like, 
sixty years worth of Arrakis’ entire income.  

478
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:28,720
The Baron has been planning this for a long time, 
and he takes no chances to crush the Atreides.  

479
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,480
In the movie, the Harkonnens use these “slow 
bombs” which decelerate so they can penetrate  

480
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,640
shields. While in the book, the Harkonnens use 
old-fashioned explosive artillery against Atreides  

481
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,440
men hiding in caves – it’s a surprise secret 
weapon to use such ancient technology. They  

482
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,320
kill or scatter all Atreides on the planet, 
and stamp out resistance by “cutting up the  

483
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:00,080
desert” with lasguns. The Harkonnens want 
“total extermination” of the Atreides. 

484
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,960
In the book, there’s a scene where the Baron and 
Piter have Jessica captive. The Baron had promised  

485
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,280
to give Jessica to Piter as his prisoner or slave 
– which is terrifying, because Piter is a sadistic  

486
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:21,120
torturer and killer. Piter is “a twisted Mentat” 
– the Baron and the Tleilaxu have corrupted him,  

487
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:28,800
made him “an animal” with violent selfish desires, 
which makes Piter a less rational, less effective  

488
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,200
thinker. Like, the Baron convinces Piter not to 
take Jessica, and instead promises him control  

489
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,920
of Arrakis – and Jessica sees that the Baron is 
lying and manipulating Piter, but with his twisted  

490
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:49,760
Mentat mind, Piter doesn’t see this. And the 
Baron fails to see how dangerous Piter is to him.  

491
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,240
So the Baron and Piter are both smart, dangerous 
people, and this is their moment of victory. But  

492
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,960
Jessica sees that they’re kind of incompetent. 
The Harkonnens’ minds are clouded and distracted  

493
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,240
by their emotions and arrogance and greed. 
They’re not focussed and disciplined like  

494
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:16,800
Jessica and Paul with their powerful human minds.
The Baron wants Duke Leto and all his family dead.  

495
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,160
The Emperor and the Bene Gesserit are okay with 
Leto dying. But they don’t want Jessica and Paul  

496
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,440
killed as well. Cause Jessica and Paul are 
important to the Bene Gesserit breeding plan  

497
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:34,240
and under the rules of warfare in Dune, murdering 
entire noble families is.. generally frowned upon.  

498
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:41,280
So the Baron can’t kill Jessica and Paul directly 
– cause the Truthsayer Gaius could interrogate him  

499
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:48,400
and learn the truth. So instead, the Baron tries 
to kill Jessica and Paul indirectly – he suggests  

500
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:55,200
that Piter may choose to dump Jessica and Paul in 
the desert, so the desert will kill them – so then  

501
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:02,400
the Baron can they say truthfully that he didn’t 
kill Jessica and Paul. The Baron twists the truth  

502
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,680
with word trickery. Dune explores how words and 
language can be deceptive, and can limit our  

503
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,520
thinking. So some of the most talkative characters 
in Dune are the bad guys. Like, in the new movie,  

504
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:22,000
the Baron doesn’t say much. But in the book, the 
Baron never shuts up, he’s constantly indulging  

505
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,760
in theatrical, self-aggrandizing speeches. 
While the heroic Atreides are men of few words.  

506
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:36,080
In Dune, the deepest truths are not expressed 
with words, but must be experienced first-hand. 

507
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:44,000
So Paul and Jessica are sent to the desert to die. 
One of the guards is deaf, and Jessica is gagged,  

508
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,400
so she can’t use her Voice power to control the 
men. Paul is not as good at the Voice as Jessica  

509
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,000
is, but he manages to command the men to ungag 
Jessica, so she can use her Voice to control  

510
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,840
and kill them. In the movie, Paul does some 
cute footwork to trip a guy, while in the book  

511
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:09,520
he kicks the dude so hard his heart stops. We 
see Yueh’s diamond symbol here on the thopter.  

512
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,440
Because Yueh has pulled some strings to help 
Paul and Jessica escape. He hides a Fremen desert  

513
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,280
survival kit in the thopter. And he arranges 
for Duncan to find them in the desert. So Yueh  

514
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,840
is forced to betray the Atreides, but he also does 
everything he can to help save Paul and Jessica. 

515
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:35,440
Yueh faces the Baron. The deal was that Yueh 
would help the Baron defeat the Atreides,  

516
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:42,160
then the Baron would free Yueh’s wife Wanna, 
let him join her. But the Baron just kills Yueh,  

517
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:48,480
so he and Wanna can “join” each other in 
death – again the Baron twists the truth with  

518
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:56,240
word trickery. So in the movie, it seems like Yueh 
just failed, the Baron beat him – but in the book,  

519
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,080
it’s different. Cause Yueh never really believed 
that the Baron would give his wife back.  

520
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:08,560
He thought she was probably already dead. But 
he needed to know for certain that Wanna is free  

521
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,640
from her suffering. Wanna was a Bene Gesserit, 
and she taught Yueh some truthsense skills.  

522
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,400
So by facing the Baron in person, and 
reading his face, Yueh learns that yes,  

523
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,480
Wanna is definitely dead, she’s free from 
Harkonnen torture, and with that knowledge,  

524
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:34,160
Yueh can die satisfied. Yueh also succeeds in 
helping Paul and Jessica escape. And gives Leto  

525
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,880
the poison tooth to attack the Baron. Yueh thinks 
that Leto was gonna die anyway, with the Emperor  

526
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,480
and Harkonnens against him, so at least Yueh gives 
Leto a chance to bring the Baron down with him.  

527
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:54,000
So Yueh feels that he succeeded – he outsmarted 
the Baron and helped the Atreides – so with his  

528
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,360
final breath, he is defiant and triumphant. 
History remembers Yueh as an evil villain,  

529
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:08,480
but in a way his death is a heroic self-sacrifice 
– dying for his Wanna, and for the Atreides. 

530
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:17,200
The Baron faces Leto helpless before him. He’s 
wanted this for a long time. House Harkonnen  

531
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,280
and House Atreides have hated each other for ten 
thousand years – ever since an Atreides banished  

532
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:29,440
a Harkonnen for cowardice after a battle. 
Now the Baron can finally destroy his ancient  

533
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:36,560
enemies. But in the book, the Baron’s victory 
feels sour. He’s disturbed by Yueh’s defiance.  

534
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:42,480
And he finds out that Paul and Jessica have 
escaped. He feels frustrated and uncertain,  

535
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:50,400
so he seeks comfort in food. Dune is about the 
importance of self-control, mastering your mind  

536
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,440
and body. So the villain, the Baron, is someone 
who’s totally controlled by his body’s desires.  

537
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:04,560
The Baron constantly eats, he is “always 
hungry and thirsty”. He has evil sexual  

538
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:11,200
desires – in the book, the Baron drugs and 
rapes slave boys. The Baron is so ruled by  

539
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,280
his urges he can’t even control the movements 
of his body – the Baron’s hands are constantly  

540
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:26,240
touching and fiddling compulsively. The Baron is 
a beast full of hunger and lust, he’s the opposite  

541
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:33,840
of the Bene Gesserit ideal of human self-control.
But while the Baron can’t control himself, he does  

542
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:41,920
control others. He treats people like objects 
to be used and exploited. He uses Yueh, he uses  

543
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:48,640
Rabban. He plans to kill Piter when he ‘outlives 
his usefulness’. He thinks of the people of  

544
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:56,000
Arrakis as “slaves”, no more than a “labor pool”. 
He thinks of his men and of his enemies as “bees”  

545
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,920
and “rabbits”, or as sheep and chickens, and of 
himself as a “carnivore”. The Baron reduces people  

546
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,720
to animals and objects, he dehumanises everyone 
around him – and that’s what makes him the  

547
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:18,320
ultimate evil in a story about the human spirit.
In Leto’s last moments, he remembers happy  

548
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:24,720
days with his family on Caladan. His last 
thought is “The day the flesh shapes and the  

549
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:31,440
flesh the day shapes”, which suggests that our 
experiences and environment make us who we are,  

550
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:37,200
and that we make our experiences and 
our environment in return. Leto feels  

551
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,040
interconnected with the universe when he dies – 
there is a legend that in the instant he died,  

552
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:50,480
a meteor streaked through the sky on Caladan.
Leto uses his poison tooth to try to kill  

553
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,720
the Baron. The gas kills Piter, but the Baron 
survives cause he has his shield on. In the movie,  

554
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:03,440
he’s still hurt by the gas, so he needs to have 
a medical black goo bath at a day spa to recover.  

555
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,040
The black goo isn’t in the book. But it is in 
the old David Lynch Dune movie, so maybe it’s  

556
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,960
a reference to that. Or it could be a reference to 
this shot in Apocalypse Now. Or maybe a reference  

557
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,120
to this bit in It’s Always Sunny, who knows.
Paul and Jessica take shelter in a stilltent.  

558
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:28,080
And Paul’s consciousness expands. The effects 
of the spice, of his training, the shock of his  

559
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:35,680
father’s death, it all comes together to unlock 
a powerful new awareness. His mind now perceives  

560
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:42,240
every detail of the world around him – he 
processes and computes vast data – like a Mentat,  

561
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:49,920
but more. Paul has visions of the future not just 
in dreams, but in waking awareness – the veil is  

562
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,600
“ripped away to reveal naked time”. He doesn’t see 
just one certain future, he sees many different  

563
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:04,800
possibilities – branching paths ever changing 
and undulating like ocean waves. He doesn’t  

564
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:11,360
see everything, much of the future is hidden to 
him. But Paul sees many things, like that Jessica  

565
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:19,120
is pregnant, and that her daughter will be “St. 
Alia of the Knife”. Paul and Jessica will stay  

566
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:26,240
on Arrakis and their eyes will turn blue from 
exposure to spice. Jessica thinks Paul must be  

567
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,560
the Kwisatz Haderach of the Bene Gesserit plan. 
But Paul says he’s something else, “something  

568
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:40,720
unexpected”, “a seed” – and he again feels his 
sense of “terrible purpose”. Paul sees a future  

569
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:47,440
of religious war – of fanatical legions spreading 
violence across the universe in the Atreides name,  

570
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:55,040
with him as their messianic leader. The book calls 
this war a “jihad” or “crusade”, and connects it  

571
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,000
to a primordial human need to spread our genes 
across the universe – to evolve and diversify the  

572
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,320
species through chaos and upheaval. It's “war as 
a collective orgasm”. Paul wants to prevent this  

573
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:17,440
terrible violent future. And in the book, he’s 
horrified by how own mind has changed. All this  

574
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:24,000
knowledge and cold logic separates Paul from 
his emotions. His father is dead, and he wants  

575
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:32,480
to grieve, but he feels nothing. His transcendence 
takes away some of his humanity. Paul feels he’s  

576
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,320
“a monster” and “A freak”, and he blames Jessica, 
cause Jessica’s training is part of what caused  

577
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,720
this change in him. Jessica suddenly feels afraid 
of this powerful mind that she helped create. 

578
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:51,120
In the book, Paul considers joining the Spacing 
Guild, cause they would appreciate his powerful  

579
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:57,920
prescient mind. But he decides not to, because 
those guys are weird and gross. Instead, he says  

580
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:04,560
he and Jessica will join the Fremen, and they will 
call him “Muad’Dib”, “The One Who Points the Way”.  

581
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,120
Muad’Dib is the name of this kangaroo-mouse which 
Paul sees in the movie a couple times. The mouse  

582
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,400
is well adapted to survive in the deserts of 
Arrakis. And the mouse has special meaning in  

583
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:24,080
Fremen mythology because one of Arrakis’ two moons 
has markings that look like the Muad’Dib mouse. 

584
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:31,920
So Paul emerges from the womb of the tent reborn. 
He has transformed and expanded his mind. And he  

585
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:40,640
is no longer a child but as a man, the new Duke 
Atreides. Now, at last, Paul can mourn his father. 

586
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,800
Paul and Jessica meet up with Duncan, and 
they take refuge with Kynes. The Emperor  

587
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,400
ordered Kynes to help destroy the Atreides, so 
Kynes is taking a huge risk by protecting them.  

588
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:59,520
But Kynes saw Leto’s heroism and leadership. 
Kynes saw that Paul fits the Fremen prophecies.  

589
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,640
And Kynes saw that the Atreides are 
interested in changing Arrakis’ environment. 

590
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:11,680
Kynes takes the Atreides to an old ecological 
station – a science lab to study the environment  

591
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:18,480
of Arrakis. The book explains that Kynes’ father, 
Pardot, taught the Fremen about ecology – the  

592
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:25,680
systems of life, climate, water, animals. Pardot 
and the Fremen made a plan to transform the  

593
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:33,360
environment of Arrakis, to make it a green planet 
full of water and plants. After Pardot died,  

594
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,800
Liet-Kynes and the Fremen have continued to change 
Arrakis – they’ve been planting vegetation in the  

595
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:46,320
desert, feeding it moisture harvested from the 
wind, starting oases of life and water, to reshape  

596
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,480
the desert. And they’re doing this secretly. The 
Fremen have been bribing the Spacing Guild with  

597
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,200
spice to hide Fremen activity from satellites.
Paul tells Kynes he could help transform  

598
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:06,960
Arrakis – if Paul becomes Emperor of the universe. 
With his new consciousness and confidence, Paul  

599
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,960
plans a play for the throne. If Paul can prove 
to other Houses of the Landsraad that the Emperor  

600
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,280
attacked the Atreides, everyone would turn 
against the Emperor. That’s the whole point  

601
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:24,480
of the Landsraad – it limits the Emperor’s power, 
to protect the Houses. So Paul plans to blackmail  

602
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,400
the Emperor, and marry one of the Emperor’s 
daughters, to take the throne himself. Then  

603
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:37,680
Paul could help Kynes change Arrakis.
So Paul shows confidence and authority. But in the  

604
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:45,200
book, he also shows humility and loyalty to Kynes 
– he says he’d give his life for Kynes – showing  

605
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,400
that Atreides heroism that makes them compelling 
leaders. And so Kynes becomes loyal to Paul. 

606
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:57,920
Then the Sardaukar attack, coming to capture or 
kill the Atreides. In the movie, the Sardaukar cut  

607
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,240
through a door with a lasgun. Lasguns are powerful 
laser weapons, but they’re also super dangerous.  

608
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:11,040
Cause if a laser beam touches a shield, the 
shield and the lasgun explode. Like, a huge  

609
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:17,040
nuclear explosion, which kills the lasgun user 
as well as their target. Earlier in the book,  

610
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:22,080
Duncan leaves a shield as a trap to blow up 
a bunch of Sardaukar. So because of that,  

611
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,640
the Sardaukar avoid using lasguns here, cause 
they’re scared of hitting a shield again. 

612
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,560
To give Paul and Jessica time to escape, 
Duncan heroically holds off the Sardaukar  

613
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:39,680
and is killed. Just like in Paul’s dream earlier. 
So this shows that Paul’s prescient visions can  

614
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:47,200
come true. Will the holy war come true as well?
Kynes Paul and Jessica escape through a secret  

615
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,240
exit. In the book, they go through a 
whole maze with lights that guide the  

616
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,160
way but then extinguish, so that 
the Sardaukar can’t follow them. 

617
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,120
In the movie, Kynes heads to the desert and uses 
a device called a thumper to attract a sandworm.  

618
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:09,200
With these maker hooks, Kynes plans to mount 
and ride a sandworm to travel, which is one of  

619
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:15,760
the great secrets of Fremen power. But Kynes is 
attacked by Sardaukar – because Kynes disobeyed  

620
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:22,800
the Emperor. Kynes defiantly says that her 
true master is Shai-Hulud – which is the Fremen  

621
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:30,000
religious name for the sandworms – “Old Father 
Eternity”. Kynes pounds the sand like a thumper,  

622
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,040
so that she and the Sardaukar are eaten by her 
god. It’s.. extremely badass, and demonstrates  

623
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:42,880
the power of the Fremen and the sandworms.
But in the book, and in the old TV miniseries,  

624
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:49,359
Kynes’ death is very different. The Harkonnens 
leave Kynes to die in the desert. He becomes  

625
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:55,840
delirious, and has hallucinations of his father 
Pardot. Pardot lectures Liet-Kynes about their  

626
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:02,080
plan to change Arrakis, with all these endless 
scientific facts and theories to control the  

627
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,920
environment. But while Kynes thinks about 
controlling the environment, the environment  

628
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:15,520
is killing him – he’s burning in the sun, birds 
circle above to eat him. And in the end, Kynes  

629
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:22,720
is killed by a spiceblow – which is the explosive 
chemical reaction that creates spice on Arrakis. 

630
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:28,960
So Kynes and his father spent their lives 
trying to master this planet. But Kynes  

631
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:35,680
gets killed by the planet he tried to control. 
His knowledge and his science can’t save him.  

632
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:43,520
This shows the limits of human knowledge 
and plans. Environmental forces, the complex  

633
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,760
ever-changing machinations of the universe, 
are bigger and more chaotic than any person  

634
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:58,480
can control. No plan or science can tame the 
universe – nature always has the last word. 

635
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:05,280
Paul and Jessica escape by flying into 
a storm. Arrakis dust-storms are deadly,  

636
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:12,880
with winds that can “cut metal like butter” and 
strip flesh to bone. It should be certain death.  

637
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,760
But with Paul’s new consciousness, in 
the book, he can perceive the forces of  

638
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:25,680
the storm – the turbulence, the vortexes, all the 
tiny gusts and fronts. He feels all these forces,  

639
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,000
and sees the right path to fly to safety.
In the movie, Paul has a vision of this Fremen  

640
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:39,520
man Jamis. Jamis says to understand a process, 
you must flow with it. This is basically Dune’s  

641
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:45,520
philosophy of how to think – the world is 
complicated, everything’s interconnected,  

642
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:52,400
ever changing. So you can’t just focus on one 
perspective or one set of data. You can’t rely  

643
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:59,360
on one narrow plan like Kynes did. Your thinking 
needs to continually evolve with the changing  

644
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:07,200
flow of reality. And that’s how Paul and Jessica 
survive the storm, by seeing and moving with its  

645
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:13,760
flow. Just as Jessica and Paul master their 
fear by allowing it to flow through them. 

646
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,720
In the movie, Paul hears the voices of 
Bene Gesserits telling him to “let go”,  

647
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,960
and so he lets go of the thopter controls, 
and loses consciousness and somehow survives,  

648
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,880
it’s like an act of faith in the movie. 
But the Dune book is not about faith,  

649
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:36,560
it’s not about losing consciousness. It’s 
about awareness and choice, and so that’s how  

650
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:42,560
Paul and Jessica fly to safety in the book.
The Harkonnens think Paul and Jessica died  

651
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,720
in the storm, and that their victory is finally 
complete. So the Baron puts Rabban back in charge  

652
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:54,720
of Arrakis, and he tells him to “squeeze” – to 
exploit and oppress the people of Arrakis to make  

653
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:01,600
as much money as possible, to make back the money 
they spent on their attack. The “Beast” Rabban is  

654
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:08,000
happy to be a brutal dictator again. In the book 
he enthusiastically suggests exterminating every  

655
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,240
person on Arrakis, and asks which weapons he’s 
allowed to use on the population. The Baron just  

656
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:20,240
orders Rabban to kill all the Fremen. In the book, 
it’s the Sardaukar who do that. But in the book,  

657
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:26,080
Rabban says it might not be easy to kill the 
Fremen. In the book, we see the Fremen kick the  

658
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,520
Sardaukar’s ass a couple times, and characters 
are shocked by how deadly the Fremen are.  

659
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,960
But the Baron doesn’t listen, and arrogantly 
dismisses the Fremen as an irrelevant rabble. 

660
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:43,520
Rabban is afraid of the Baron – the book says 
the Baron usually won’t kill family members,  

661
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,160
but he does inflict “painful” 
punishments. So Rabban obeys. 

662
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,160
In the book, there’s a lot more 
going on in the Harkonnen plotline,  

663
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,400
with other important characters, which 
we should see in the next Dune movie. 

664
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,640
Paul and Jessica travel the desert. Living 
off their own water in stillsuits, they begin  

665
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,480
a true Arrakeen existence. The rhythm of 
the environment shapes their movements,  

666
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:15,120
changes when they sleep, changes how they think. 
They get a feel for the textures of the desert,  

667
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:22,400
all the different kinds of sand – pea sand, 
drum sand, flour and grit and dust and powder.  

668
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,800
The desert looks like an “ocean”, “full of 
moon-silvered waves”. Author Frank Herbert got the  

669
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,880
idea for Dune when he was researching sand dunes 
in Oregon. He learned that dunes move and flow  

670
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:41,360
like water, just slower. That began his research 
into environments, and history and religions and  

671
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,480
linguistics that led to Dune.
Paul starts to like Arrakis.  

672
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:54,240
But Jessica just misses Caladan, and misses Leto.
In the book, Jessica gets buried under a sand  

673
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:01,040
slide. So she uses her Bene Gesserit training to 
hold her body in a coma so she doesn’t suffocate,  

674
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:07,520
while Paul uses his powerful mind to figure out 
where she’s buried, and saves her. He does a cute  

675
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:14,000
chemistry experiment, mixing battery acid with 
spice to make a foam to hold back the sand. It’s a  

676
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,320
fun little science-fiction problem-solving scene, 
using Paul’s mind and simple tools to survive. 

677
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,320
To find the Fremen, Paul and Jessica have 
to cross an expanse of open sand. Which  

678
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:34,000
is super dangerous because of the deadly worms. 
Sandworms swim these sands like sharks in the sea.  

679
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,240
But Paul and Jessica face this danger just like 
the Old Duke faced the bull. Author Frank Herbert  

680
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:46,960
said sandworms are like the bull in the arena, or 
the archetypal dragon in the cave, guarding the  

681
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:54,240
treasure of spice – the worm is the monster that 
the hero must face. To avoid attracting a worm,  

682
01:11:54,240 --> 01:12:00,800
they have to “walk without rhythm” – a sandwalk 
that imitates the natural sounds of the desert.  

683
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,480
In the book, they also set a thumper to distract 
the worms. And it turns out it’s very difficult  

684
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:13,360
to walk without rhythm while you can hear the 
rhythm of the thumper. It’s yet another test of  

685
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:21,200
control over the body and mind. Paul accidentally 
steps on drum sand, which makes louds vibrations,  

686
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:27,040
and it summons a worm, so they’ve gotta leg 
it to the safety of rock. Paul and Jessica are  

687
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:34,080
shocked by the size of the worm. In the book, 
its mouth is eighty metres or 260 feet across,  

688
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:40,240
with crystal teeth glimmering the moonlight, and 
breath that smells like cinnamon from the spice.  

689
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,080
Paul wonders about the mystery of exactly 
how spice and sandworms are connected.  

690
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:51,920
The book mentions that sandworms’ bodies create 
oxygen which is how the air is breathable on  

691
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,360
Arrakis without many plants making oxygen 
like on Earth. But they survive the worm,  

692
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,920
and then they face Stilgar and his Fremen. And 
we start to learn more about Fremen culture. 

693
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,320
In the book, Stilgar asks if Paul and Jessica are 
“jinn”, which is an Arabic word for supernatural  

694
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:17,520
spirits. Stilgar mentions “Istislah”, an Islamic 
term relating to the common good. Jessica thinks  

695
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,920
the Fremen speak “the language of Ilm and Fiqh” 
– which are Arabic words for knowledge and law. 

696
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:30,800
Cause the Fremen and their language are loosely 
inspired by real Arabic and Islamic cultures.  

697
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,240
Author Frank Herbert was particularly influenced 
by a book called The Sabres of Paradise about  

698
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:42,800
Muslims in the Caucasus – it describes a religious 
warrior people who speak a “Chakobsa” language,  

699
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:50,160
and fight against imperial “Padishah” invaders, 
who live in a “Sietch” or “tabr”. There are entire  

700
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:56,240
lines in Dune that are taken from this book. 
Frank was also inspired by Lawrence of Arabia,  

701
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:01,040
a Western man who joined with Bedouin 
desert tribes in their fight against the  

702
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:07,760
Ottoman Empire. Stilgar says the Fremen are “the 
Ichwan Bedwine”, which sounds like “Bedouin”.  

703
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:13,200
Frank was also inspired by the people of the 
Kalahari desert, and their careful use of  

704
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,280
water. As well as indigenous American groups. So 
many different real cultures inspired the Fremen. 

705
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,720
In-universe, the Dune book says that 
Fremen are descended from Sunni Muslims in  

706
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:29,200
Egypt – “Misr” is Arabic for Egypt, and 
“Nilotic al-Ourouba”, suggests the Nile and  

707
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:35,840
Arabia. Over thousands of years, this peoples’ 
religion changed into the Zensunni tradition – a  

708
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:42,400
combination of Zen Buddhism with Sunni Islam. 
The Zensunni Wanderers suffered millennia of  

709
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:48,880
persecution and displacement, including nine 
generations of slavery on Selusa Secundus.  

710
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,800
Eventually they settled on Arrakis, and developed 
the unique Fremen culture, adapted to life in the  

711
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:01,200
desert, and hardened by their suffering.
Survival on Arrakis can require brutal  

712
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:08,080
decisions for the good of the group – so Stilgar’s 
Fremen threaten to kill Jessica to take her water.  

713
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:14,480
So Jessica uses her Bene Gesserit fighting skills 
to kick Stilgar’s arse. And Paul beats up the  

714
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:21,440
Fremen man Jamis. So Jessica proves that she has 
useful skills, and Stilgar agrees to keep her.  

715
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:28,240
In the book, he has some fun dialogue calling one 
of his men a “wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained  

716
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:35,600
piece of lizard turd!”. Stilgar is charismatic, 
and a powerful leader, dedicated to protecting  

717
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:43,040
his tribe. He’s also very intelligent, and willing 
to adapt to change. He asks Jessica to teach his  

718
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:48,640
Fremen how to fight in her “weirding way”. And 
the Fremen will teach Jessica and Paul to survive  

719
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:55,680
in the desert. It will be “a good exchange of 
teachings” – Dune values knowledge and learning. 

720
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:02,400
In the book, Jessica does more of her Missionaria 
Protectiva manipulations, trying to convince the  

721
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:08,960
Fremen that she and Paul fit the Lisan al-Gaib 
prophecy. Jessica brings up Sietch Tabr, Stilgar’s  

722
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,800
home, as though she has some mystical knowledge of 
the place – but really she just read the name on a  

723
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:22,800
map once – “If only he knew the tricks we use!”, 
she thinks. Jessica feels a “cynical bitterness”  

724
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:29,920
at her manipulation. But she’s determined to use 
the Fremen as an army to help Paul retake Arrakis. 

725
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:37,120
Paul meets Chani, and he’s shocked to recognise 
her from his visions. In the books she has  

726
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:44,240
an “elfin face”, a laughing voice, the grace 
of a gazelle, and she has “red hair”. Paul  

727
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:49,680
feels embarrassed that she caught him with a 
gun, and he immediately has a crush on her. 

728
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:57,600
Jamis is angry that Paul beat him up. So Jamis 
challenges Paul, invoking the amtal rule.  

729
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,920
Amtal means to test something until it breaks, 
to learn someone’s true nature by pushing them  

730
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:10,800
to their limits, like the gom jabbar – Jamis 
will fight Paul to the death. In the book,  

731
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:17,040
Jamis says this will test whether Paul and 
Jessica are the Lisan al-Gaib. He argues that  

732
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:23,280
Jessica might be making “a false way among us”, 
trying to deceive the Fremen to fit the prophecy,  

733
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:28,960
which.. she is. In the book, Jessica uses 
the Voice on Jamis, and threatens him,  

734
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:36,240
but the Fremen realise she’s manipulating him and 
order her to be silent. So Paul faces Jamis alone. 

735
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:44,160
Paul has seen possible futures from this 
moment, and in most of them, Paul dies. He  

736
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:50,320
is at the centre of a nexus in time, a storm 
of possibilities, where the slightest mistake  

737
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:56,400
could change the future dramatically. There are 
too many branching possibilities for Paul to see  

738
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:03,600
a clear path to victory. The only way to survive 
this is with his skills, his mind, and his knife. 

739
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,160
In the book, Chani gives Paul 
advice on how to beat Jamis,  

740
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:14,320
warning him about Jamis’ fighting style. But in 
the movie, Chani says she doesn’t believe in Paul  

741
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:19,920
and that he’s gonna die. Which is a fun 
change – making Chani more sceptical of Paul. 

742
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:25,840
In the movie, Chani gives Paul a crysknife 
– and this is the same knife that Paul kept  

743
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:33,280
seeing in visions. Paul saw Chani stabbing him 
with this knife. Will this vision come true? 

744
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:41,440
Paul salutes Jamis in the same way that Duncan 
saluted earlier – an echo of his fallen friend.  

745
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,320
And they prepare to fight. In the book,  

746
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,840
Paul and Jamis fight wearing just loincloths. 
But in the movie they wear their stillsuits,  

747
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,840
so we don’t get to see Timothee 
Chalamet in just his “fighting trunks”. 

748
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:59,600
In the movie, Paul hears the voices of 
Bene Gesserit telling him not to be afraid,  

749
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:06,480
not to resist, to fulfil his destiny as the 
Kwisatz Haderach. But in the book, Paul doesn’t  

750
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:14,160
rely on destiny – he focusses on his training. On 
the advice of Jessica, Duncan and Gurney. On his  

751
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:21,280
Bene Gesserit mastery of his body and mind. Paul 
is “a fighting machine” trained from infancy by  

752
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:26,800
some of the best warriors in the universe.
But in the book, Paul’s training gives him  

753
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:32,880
a disadvantage. Cause Paul is trained for 
shield-fighting. He learned to attack slowly,  

754
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:39,440
so his blade can penetrate shields. But Jamis 
has no shield. The Fremen don’t use shields,  

755
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:46,160
because shields attract sandworms. So Paul 
keeps attacking Jamis too slowly. While Jamis,  

756
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:51,120
who isn’t trained with shields, attacks 
faster than Paul is used to. So Paul has  

757
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:57,040
to change his fighting style. Sometimes to 
survive, you have to unlearn old assumptions. 

758
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:05,040
So Paul kills Jamis, winning the respect of 
the Fremen. Jessica is relieved that her son  

759
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,960
survived. But in the book, she does something 
interesting. Jessica immediately comes up and  

760
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:18,880
calls Paul a killer, her voice harsh and full 
of scorn. She deliberately makes Paul feel bad  

761
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:26,160
about killing Jamis. Because Paul gets a lot 
of attention and validation for this victory,  

762
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:33,120
including from the girl of his dreams, Chani. 
Jessica doesn’t want Paul to learn to enjoy  

763
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:39,040
killing. So she applies some emotional 
conditioning to keep Paul’s morality in line. 

764
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:46,000
In the movie, there’s a sadness to Jamis’ 
death. Cause earlier, Paul had visions of  

765
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,240
Jamis being a “friend”, someone who taught Paul 
about the desert. But because of Paul’s choices,  

766
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:57,920
and chance – that vision didn’t come true, and 
Paul had to kill the man who could have been his  

767
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:04,400
friend. So Paul’s visions aren’t guaranteed, just 
possibilities. They’re like predictions, plans,  

768
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:11,600
hopes and fears in the real world – they can 
guide us to achieve our goals, but they can also  

769
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:19,520
limit our thinking. Dune explores the power 
and the danger of predictions and dreams. 

770
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:26,560
In the book, Paul cries for Jamis, and the 
Fremen see crying as a profound sacred act,  

771
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:32,880
because of how precious water is in the desert. 
Paul says that Jamis was his friend, that Jamis  

772
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:39,760
taught him that killing has a price. So maybe, 
in a way, Paul’s vision of Jamis as a friend,  

773
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:46,080
who taught him, did come true after all.
The Fremen wrap up Jamis’ body and take it  

774
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:50,720
with them. Because when a Fremen dies, 
the water is drained from their body  

775
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:56,800
in a “deathstill” and reclaimed for the Fremen 
to use. “The flesh belongs to the person,  

776
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,320
but his water belongs to the tribe”.
In the movie, Paul gives a confident  

777
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:07,962
heroic speech. He says he sees his future, 
and he chooses to be with the Fremen. It’s  

778
01:22:07,962 --> 01:22:11,840
an uplifting and optimistic end to the movie. But 
at this point in the book, the vibe is darker and  

779
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:18,400
uncertain. Paul and Jessica are unsure about the 
Fremen, but feel forced to use them to survive.  

780
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:25,360
Paul doesn’t see his future clearly – he feels 
he is ‘plunged into the abyss’. He’s afraid of  

781
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:32,320
his visions of the bloody Jihad, and desperately 
hopes to prevent it. Paul’s destiny is dangerous. 

782
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:39,120
We see a Fremen riding a sandworm to travel – 
there’s much more to learn about the power of  

783
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:45,440
the Fremen and their desert. Chani says “This 
is only the beginning”, and it really is.  

784
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,840
This movie only covers the first half 
of the first book in the Dune trilogy.  

785
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:57,600
Which itself is just the beginning of a larger 
series. There is so much more to this story. 

786
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:04,720
Frank Herbert said that the first Dune book has a 
“coital” rhythm. Meaning the pacing of the story  

787
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:10,960
is like sex – it starts slow, and speeds 
up, then suddenly climactically ends.  

788
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:17,920
So by ending this movie halfway through the 
first book, Denis Villeneuve stops mid-coitus,  

789
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,400
leaving us with waiting, without a 
climax, until Dune Part Two comes out. 

790
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:29,440
This movie is a mostly faithful adaptation of 
the first half of the first book. It introduces  

791
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:36,080
the worlds and politics of the Imperium, the 
mysterious Spacing Guild, the scheming Bene  

792
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:42,240
Gesserit. The evil Harkonnens defeat the Atreides, 
Paul and Jessica escape to the Fremen, and they  

793
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:49,920
start to learn the ways of the desert. We see 
Paul’s complicated destiny and ambiguous visions,  

794
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:56,800
and hints of the dangers of the messiah. The 
movie introduces ideas of the environment and  

795
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:03,520
religion and political exploitation and the 
power of the mind. But the movie leaves out some  

796
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:10,240
important scenes like the dinner party, and the 
traitor subplot. It doesn’t capture the tragedy  

797
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:18,240
of Doctor Yueh, the meaning of Kynes’ death, or 
the darker manipulative side of Leto and Jessica.  

798
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:23,840
It removes some of the Arabic references from 
the Fremen, and it skips plotlines with the  

799
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:29,040
Harkonnens and with Thufir. Hopefully 
we’ll get this in the next Dune movie. 

800
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,640
But to understand the meaning of Paul’s story, 
and the message of Dune, we’ve got to talk  

801
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:41,280
about the other books. So we’ve got a new video 
called the Philosophy of Dune, coming out soon.  

802
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:47,760
We’ve also got a Podcast episode out now talking 
about Dune with Quinn, from Quinn’s Ideas.  

803
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:54,800
We’re also doing a Q&A livestream about Dune on 
this channel in 24 hours. And for some reason,  

804
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:00,880
professional shitposter Alt Schwift X has 
released a rap about Dune. So check out all  

805
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:07,520
that Dune content linked below. We will make more 
Dune videos in the future. And we’re covering more  

806
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:13,280
Song of Ice and Fire, and the upcoming Game of 
Thrones prequel TV show House of the Dragon. 

807
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:17,120
House of the Dragon is based 
on a book called Fire & Blood.
